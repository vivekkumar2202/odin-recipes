        <li>½ cup peas</li>
        <li>½ cup diced carrot</li>
        <li>½ cup diced potato</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground red chile pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt ghee in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, 
            and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in cumin seed, 
            cinnamon stick, and peppercorns; cook until the spices are 
            fragrant, and the cumin seeds begin to pop, about 3 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in ginger garlic paste, tomatoes, and 1/2 cup water. 
            Bring to a simmer, and cook until the water has evaporated, 
            about 5 minutes. Stir in peas, carrot, and potato. Season 
            with chicken bouillon, salt, red chile, black pepper, garam 
            masala, and turmeric. Stir well, then cover, and cook for 3 
            minutes</li>
        <li>Pour in 4 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Once 
            boiling, stir in basmati rice, reduce heat to medium, recover, 
            and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue to 
            cook until the rice has softened, 10 to 15 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
